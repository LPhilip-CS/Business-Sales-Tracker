# Pizza Sales Tracker
In this project, I showcase my skills in data analysis with a focus on PIZZA sales. Using SQL, I've cleaned and explored pizza sales data, extracting valuable insights into trends and patterns.
In Tableau, where I've transformed raw data into engaging visualizations that tell the story of pizza sales dynamics. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Explore the factors influencing pizza sales depending on toppings, size and even time. 
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in the sales data.
- Provide valuable insights for buisnesses and steakholders. 

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes detailed information regarding pizza sales over the corse of a year.
- Key variables include orders, dates, category, pricing, and more. 
- Access the raw dataset through the 'PizzaSales.xlsx' or the 'PizzaSales.csv' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Rectify missing values, identifies outliers, and standardizes formats.
- Ensures the integrity of data and maintains format consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Centers on deriving valuable KPI requirements from the dataset through SQL queries. 
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes.
- dentifies the top and bottom-performing pizza types.
- Aggregates data over time to observe evolving pizza sales trends.
- Investigate correlations between sales and other variables.


Visualization:
- Utilize Excel charts, such as line graphs, bar charts, and butterfly charts, to represent variations in sales over time or across different variables.
- Include interactive dashboards using Tableau features like filters, data blending, custom calcualtions and powerful data visualizations. 
- These dashboards enhance the user experience by allowing dynamic exploration of the data.


## Answering Questions:
- Identify varying KPI requirments (total revenue, average order value, pizzas sold, total orders, and more)?
- Weekly and hourly trend for total orders?
- Percentage of sales by pizza toppings and size?
- 5 best and worst selling pizzas by revenue, total quantity, and total orders?

## Working in SQL:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the PizzaSales.csv in the Excel folder.
- Run the 'ExploratoryAnalysis.sql' file to view the exploratory data analysis on pizza sales.

## Working in Tableau:
- Navigate the 'Pizza Sales Tracker.twbx' file to interact with dynamic charts and graphs.
- Utilize Tableau functions and tools to conduct in-depth analysis (filter through dates and different categories).
- Effectively convey findings through visual representation and derive meaningful insights and conclusions.
  
## Feedback and Support:
- Provide your feedback, suggestions, or report any issues.
- Your contributions to the Pizza Sales Tracker Project is appreciated!
