# Pizza Sales Tracker
In this project, I showcase my skills in data analysis with a focus on üçï. Using SQL, I've cleaned and explored pizza sales data, extracting valuable insights into trends and patterns.
In Tableau, where I've transformed raw data into engaging visualizations that tell the story of pizza sales dynamics. 

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Explore the factors influencing pizza sales depending on toppings, size and even time. 
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in the sales data.
- Provide valuable insights for buisnesses and steakholders. 

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes detailed information regarding pizza sales over the corse of a year.
- Key variables include orders, dates, category, pricing, and more. 
- Access the dataset through the 'PizzaSales.xlsx' or the 'PizzaSales.csv' file.

## Project Structure:
Data Cleaning:
- Find the data cleaning script in the 'DataCleaning.sql' file.
- Addresses missing values, and outliers, and standardizes formats.
- Ensure data integrity and format consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset using SQL queries. 
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes.
- Aggregate data over time to observe temporal trends in life expectancy.
- Explore correlations between life expectancy and other variables using the correlation coefficient (if applicable).


Visualization:
- Utilize Excel charts, such as line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots, to represent variations in life expectancy over time or across different variables.
- include interactive dashboards using Excel features like slicers, pivot tables, and charts.
- These dashboards enhance the user experience by allowing dynamic exploration of the data.


## Answering Questions:
- Which top 5 countries have the highest average life expectancy?
- Is there a drastic change in life expectancy (2007-2022) worldwide?
- Is there a correlation between life expectancy and a country's status (developed vs. developing)?
- What are the overall mortality rates among the age ranges in the United States?

## Working in SQL:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Import the dataset from the WorldLifeExpectancy.csv or run 'DatabaseScript.sql' to manually populate the database.
- Run the files in sequential order: DatabaseScript, DataCleaning, and ExploratoryAnalysis.

## Working in Excel:
- Explore the 'WorldLifeExpectancy.xlsx' file for interactive charts and graphs.
- Leverage Excel functions and tools for further analysis.
- Communicate findings effectively through visual representation and come up with insights and conclusions.

## Feedback and Support:
- Share your feedback, suggestions, or report issues.
- Thank you for contributing to the World Life Expectancy Project! Together, we can unravel valuable insights for a healthier global future.
